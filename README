This program will load and parse (some) of the data contained in a Wavefront .obj file. Namely, it reads the vertex and face data, and fills out an internal structure with that information.
All n-sided polygons contained within the file will be converted to triangles upon being loaded.

Doesn't display the contents or anything fancy like that (yet), but maybe some day I'll get around to adding functionality like that, once the program itself works at all.
