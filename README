This program is intended to load vertex and face data from Wavefront .obj files.
It is currently undergoing heavy revision, and is subject to break unexpectedly as I continue to mess with it.

Currently written only to run on Linux systems, as it strays away from a lot of the standard library functions. At some point I may change that once
I get it working at all.
